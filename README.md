## Intro

*gov4git* is a decentralized protocol for governing open-source communities based on git.

It is a wholistic framework for lifelong governance of open-source projects, which is secure, flexible, transparent, and pluralistic.

*gov4git* is designed to be practical and accessible. It requires git hosting as the only persistent infrastructure. It is easy (and continuously getting easier) to deploy by non-technical users, using an accompanying command-line client or a desktop app.
