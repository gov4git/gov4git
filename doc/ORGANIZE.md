## Community organizer's manual

The first responsibility of the organizer is to deploy the governance system. This task is documented in the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOY.md).

Once the governance system is up and running, the organizer is responsible for governing the day-to-day function of the community, as described in the [Governance Guide](GOVERN.md).
