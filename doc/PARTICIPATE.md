## Community member's manual

### Overview

To participate in governance, community members can interface with the system through the desktop app and the GitHub project's issues and PRs.

The desktop app is the primary point of contact where the community member user can:
- Create their decentralized Gov4Git identity (owned by the user themselves and not specific to any one community)
- Request to join a community
- Manage connections to multiple communities
- Manage multiple Gov4Git identities
- View the user's credits account balance in a community
- View and vote on open issues and PRs
