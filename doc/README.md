## User's manual

This documentation is a user's manual for gov4git.

### Roles and responsibilities

There are two distinct roles (i.e. types of users) involved in a gov4git-governed open-source project:
- the community **organizer** is the person who owns the project repository which is to be governed
- a community **member** is a person who contributes to the project repository and participates in the governance of the project

The organizer is responsible for:
- **deploying** the governance system
- **managing** the day-to-day operations of the governance system (such as managing membership and access rights, creating polls and referendums, etc.)

The members are responsible for:
- **participating** in the governance system (such as voting, proposing issues and pull requests, contributing to the project, and so on.)

### The organizer's manual

The first responsibility of the organizer is to deploy the governance system. This task is documented in the [Deployment Guide](deploy-github.md).

The entire functionality of the gov4git system and protocol is captured in the gov4git command-line client, which is also the reference implementation of the protocol.

Here is a growing list of resources, describing the client:
