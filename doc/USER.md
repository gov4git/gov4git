# User manual

This documentation is a user's manual for gov4git.

## Roles and responsibilities

There are two distinct roles (i.e. types of users) involved in a gov4git-governed open-source project:
- the community **organizer** is the person who owns the project repository which is to be governed
- a community **member** is a person who contributes to the project repository and participates in the governance of the project

The organizer is responsible for:
- **deploying** the governance system
- **governing** the day-to-day operations of the community (such as managing membership and access rights, creating polls and referendums, etc.)

These are covered in the [Organizer's Manual](ORGANIZE.md).

The members are responsible for:
- **joining** the community and 
- **participating** in the community governance (such as voting, proposing issues and pull requests, contributing to the project, and so on.)

These are covered in the [Member's Manual](PARTICIPATE.md)
